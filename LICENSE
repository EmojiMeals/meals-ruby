RATATOUILLE RECIPE

1. Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).

2. Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch
(1-mm) rounds, then set aside.

3. Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over 
medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 
minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the 
ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once 
more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.

4. Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, 
tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of 
the pan. Season with salt and pepper.

5. Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, 
thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.

6. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 
minutes, until the vegetables are softened.

7. Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next 
day--cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply 
microwave to desired temperature.

8. Enjoy!
